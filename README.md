# EDU_data_tool
A webpage to serve EDU the data it needs in a user-friendly environment

This tool will be using Django and Pandas to create a webpage that will allow EDU team members easy access to data from our MySQL database. There are several processes that involve complex computation or copius manual intervention, such as generating a list of emails from a student cohort for an alumni survey or getting freshly flagged guides for our editing project, so this will be a way for EDU to work smarter (not harder) while not requiring an advanced knowledge of SQL or Sheets.

I'm also hoping that this can be hosted in a way that will only allow access to iFixit employees, in a way similar to Shiny. That being said, this tool will deal with confidential information (student email addresses) so additional security might be something we need to address.
